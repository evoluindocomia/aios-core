# Getting Started with Antigravity

> **Version:** 2.0 | **Updated:** 2026-02-26

Complete guide to start using AIOS on Antigravity (Gemini IDE) — from zero to your first development cycle.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** 8+
- **Git** installed
- **Antigravity** IDE (Google Gemini Code Assist or Gemini IDE)
- AIOS installed in the project (see installation below)

---

## 1. Installing AIOS

### New Project

```bash
# Creates the full project structure with AIOS
npx aios-core init my-project
cd my-project
```

The `init` command automatically creates:

- `.antigravity/` — Antigravity configuration (agents, rules, skills, workflows)
- `.aios-core/` — Core framework (tasks, templates, checklists)
- `docs/` — Documentation structure
- `squads/` — Specialized agent packs

### Existing Project

```bash
# Adds AIOS to an existing project
cd existing-project
npx aios-core install
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
npx aios-core doctor    # Full diagnostic
npx aios-core info      # Version and status
```

---

## 2. Understanding the Master Document

Every Antigravity session begins with `ANTIGRAVITY.md` being read automatically. It defines:

- **Constitution** — 6 core principles (CLI First, Agent Authority, etc.)
- **Default language** — PT-BR (configurable)
- **Agent system** — who does what
- **Workflow selection guide** — which workflow to use in each situation
- **Governance** — mandatory checks before critical operations

> File: [`.antigravity/ANTIGRAVITY.md`](../../../../.antigravity/ANTIGRAVITY.md)

## 3. Choosing the Right Workflow

Before invoking an agent, identify the right workflow for your situation:

### New project

```
"I want to build a fullstack application from scratch"
  → Antigravity uses: greenfield-fullstack.md
  → Sequence: @analyst → @pm → @ux → @architect → @po → @dev → @qa → @devops
```

```
"I need only a backend/API"
  → greenfield-service.md

"I need only a frontend/landing page"
  → greenfield-ui.md  (+ Stitch MCP via @ui-builder)
```

### Existing project

```
"I've never worked on this project — I need to understand it first"
  → brownfield-discovery.md
  → @architect maps → @data-engineer audits DB → @ux audits frontend

"I know the project — I want to add a fullstack feature"
  → brownfield-fullstack.md

"I want to add an endpoint to the existing backend"
  → brownfield-service.md

"I want to add a page/component to the existing frontend"
  → brownfield-ui.md
```

### During development

```
"I have an idea → I want a complete backlog"
  → spec-pipeline.md

"I have a ready epic → I want to run all stories"
  → epic-orchestration.md

"I have a story → I want to implement it"
  → story-development-cycle.md (SDC - Uses @dev or @ui-builder)

"QA failed → I need to fix and re-validate"
  → qa-loop.md  (max 5 iterations, automatic escalation)
```

---

## 4. Activating Agents

Use the `@` prefix to invoke any agent:

```
@dev           → Dex, lead developer
@qa            → Quinn, quality & testing
@architect     → Aria, system architecture
@pm            → Kai, product management
@po            → Nova, product owner & stories
@sm            → River, scrum master
@analyst       → Zara, research & analysis
@data-engineer → Dara, database & schema
@ux            → Uma, UX/UI design
@ui-builder    → Autonomous UI Builder (Google Stitch)
@devops        → Gage, CI/CD and git push
@brad-frost    → Brad Frost, Design System (Atomic Design)
@squad-chief   → Squad Architect 🎨
```

**Examples:**

```
@architect create the architecture for the payments service
```

```
@dev implement the authentication endpoint per story 3.2
```

## 5. Agent Commands (`*`)

Within an agent context, use `*` to trigger specific actions:

| Command              | What It Does                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `*help`              | List all available commands           |
| `*create-story`      | Create a new development story        |
| `*task {name}`       | Run a specific task                   |
| `*qa-loop {storyId}` | Start a QA correction iteration cycle |
| `*push`              | (@devops exclusive) — push to remote  |
| `*status`            | Show epic or workflow progress        |
| `*exit`              | Exit agent mode                       |

---

## 6. Full Development Cycle (SDC)

The **Story Development Cycle** is the standard flow for implementing any feature:

```
1. @sm *draft         → Outlines the story with epic context
2. @po *validate      → Validates acceptance criteria (GO / NO-GO)
3. @dev *develop      → Implements logic/backend (or @ui-builder for UI screens)
4. @qa *qa-gate       → Quality gate — PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL
5. @devops *push      → Push to remote (exclusive authority)
```

**If QA fails** → `qa-loop.md` takes over (max 5 iterations, then auto-escalation).

> ⚠️ **Non-negotiable rule:** Only `@devops` can run `git push`. All other agents must delegate.

---

## 7. Automatic Governance

Antigravity proactively verifies before each critical operation:

| Operation                      | Mandatory Check                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Write to `supabase/functions/` | Architecture documentation approved? |
| Create `squads/*/agents/*.md`  | DNA extracted for mind-clones?       |
| Run SQL DDL                    | Using `supabase migration` CLI?      |
| `git push`                     | Active agent is `@devops`?           |
| `git worktree add/remove`      | Active agent is `@devops`?           |
| Use `mcp_stitch_*`             | UI/Design System workflow context?   |
| Slugs/IDs                      | Valid `snake_case` format?           |

## 8. Exclusive Antigravity Tools

Capabilities that Claude Code **does not have**:

### Image Generation

```
@ux create a mockup for the product login screen
→ Uses: generate_image() — returns a real image
```

### UI Design with Stitch MCP

```
@ui-builder generate the main dashboard screens based on the front-end-spec
→ Uses: mcp_stitch_generate_screen_from_text()
→ Creates high-fidelity wireframes and raw code without external tools
```

### Browser Automation

```
@qa visually validate the login component in a browser
→ Uses: browser_subagent()
→ Automatically records a WebP video of the tested flow
```

---

## 9. Creating a Specialized Squad

```
@squad-chief I want a digital marketing squad
```

`@squad-chief` will:

1. Research elite minds in the domain
2. Extract behavioral and thinking DNA from each expert
3. Create agents based on real expert personalities
4. Generate the full squad structure in `squads/`

> Workflow: [`.antigravity/workflows/create-squad.md`](../../../../.antigravity/workflows/create-squad.md)

---

## 10. Worktrees — Parallel Development

To work on multiple features simultaneously:

```
@devops, create a worktree for the payments feature
→ Workflow: auto-worktree.md
→ Creates isolated branch: feat/payments
→ Development occurs without affecting main
```

---

## 11. Local Testing and Validation of the Installer

If you are contributing to AIOS development or need to validate the installer locally without publishing it to NPM, you can use two main strategies:

### Option 1: Packaging Simulation via NPM Pack (Recommended)

This option exactly simulates the end-user behavior unpacking the package via `npx`.

1. In the original project root (where the main `aios-core` `package.json` is located), run:
   ```bash
   npm pack
   ```
2. A `.tgz` file will be generated (e.g., `aios-core-4.4.6.tgz`).
3. In a separate test environment folder, execute the command pointing to the local file:
   ```bash
   npx "/absolute/path/to/aios-core-4.4.6.tgz" init my-test-project
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Node Execution (For Debugging)

This option is ideal for inspecting the code line by line using breakpoints in your IDE (e.g., VSCode).

1. Create an isolated test folder.
2. From that folder's terminal (or via your IDE's `launch.json`), execute the main Javascript file directly via Node:
   ```bash
   node "/absolute/path/to/aios-core/bin/aios.js" init my-test-project
   ```
