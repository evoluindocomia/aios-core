# Antigravity Environment

> **Version:** 2.0 | **Language:** EN | **Updated:** 2026-02-26 | **Status:** ✅ Production

**Antigravity** is the native configuration and agent orchestration environment for Synkra AIOS, built for the **Google Gemini** IDE. It replaces the legacy `.claude/` environment with a richer, workflow-complete structure.

> In simple terms: `.antigravity/` is to Antigravity what `.claude/` is to Claude Code — the system's brain. But with capabilities Claude Code doesn't have.

## Core Principles

- **CLI First**: All implementations start from the terminal. UI is never a prerequisite.
- **Minds First**: Real frameworks from real experts > generic bot instructions.
- **Story Driven**: All code must originate from a validated Story.
- **Governance Inline**: Safety checks are built into agent instructions.
- **Reuse > Adapt > Create**: Always search for existing solutions before building new.
